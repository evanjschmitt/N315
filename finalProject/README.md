# Final Project
## Kuereg Site Replica

This site showcases firebase authentication, as well as data integreation via JSON. 

### Created By: Ev Schmitt

### Project Requirements: 
* Your site needs to resemble (this site)[https://www.keurig.com/c/coffeemakers101?cm_sp=bo+cybermonday21-_-promo+hero+banner-_-shop+coffee+makers].
* Nothing else needs to work on the page, but you must have everything on there 
* * ex. navigation, banner, footer etc..
* Your project must have a create account and log-in section. 
* * There should be an icon in the top right corner of the page to show the user where to click to log in or create an account. 
* * When logged in it should give me the option to log out. 
* You must show a cart icon in the top right-hand corner that shows the count of how many coffee makers you have purchased.
* * When clicked on, your cart page must show all the coffee makers you have clicked the buy now button on. 
* * Your shopping cart page must have an empty cart button that will empty all products. 
* Each product must have at least:
* * product image
* * product name
* * product price
* * buy now button
* All of this must look like the site. 
* * I would load all the products in a JSON file and load them on the page. This will make adding things to the cart easier.
* Any other data can be stored in JSON that is held in memory, meaning it will not be saved if the page is refreshed. 
* * If you want to use the local storage built into a browser that would work too. 
* You have to make this page responsive.
* Make sure you look at the font and use a similar font. 
* You must use the MVC model and view injection to allow for a one-page navigation. 
* * Also, use URL navigating. 
* You DO NOT have to make any ad pop-ups.
