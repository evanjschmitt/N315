# Homework07: JungleCook Login Functions

## Purpose

You will need to make the login page from the Jungle Cook prototype work with Firebase. You must let a user sign up and sign in with an email and a password. They must also see an updated navigation menu when they are logged in.

Remember that this will be a dynamic site at the end to plan your project accordingly.

## Instructions

- Your login page must look identical to the prototype in all media, meaning it must be responsive.
- You must use Firebase's authentication to allow a user to create an account using an email and a password.
- The navigation of the site must update with the correct information from the prototype.
- Upload this to the web 4 server and Github and submit the Github link to this project.
