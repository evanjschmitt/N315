# Homework06: Intro to JungleCook

## Purpose

You must create the login and home pages from the Jungle Cook prototype. This page must look identical to the prototype on all media. Laptop, Tablet, and Mobile. You must also have the hamburger menu working in your project. 

Remember that this will be a dynamic site at the end to plan your project accordingly. 

## Instructions

* Your login page must look identical to the prototype in all media, meaning it must be responsive. 
* When it is completely finished, you need to think about this being a fully dynamic site, so set it up accordingly. 
* You must have the mobile menu working as well as the normal menu. 
* Upload this to the web 4 server and Github and submit the Github link to this project.
