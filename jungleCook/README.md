# Homework08: JungleCook Completion

## JugnleCook

JungleCook is a CRUD Application that allows users to add, edit, and view recipes. Using firebase for user authentication, users have the ability to sign in and make accounts for the site. 

The site is fully responsive from desktop view down to mobile, with a hambuger menu replacing the nav bar. Sweet Alerts are used for user feedback, mainly during login/out interactions.

## Instructions

- You must have user feedback i.e. have alerts showing when loading data or something happens so the user knows something is wrong. 
- You will be using JSON for the data for this project. This will be a JSON file from a local folder.
- For the CRUD you must be able to create a recipe, delete the recipe, display all recipes and update a recipe. If you can not do any of that, then this is not a CRUD application. The navigation of the site must update with the correct information from the prototype.
- Upload this to the web 4 server and Github and submit the Github link to this project.
